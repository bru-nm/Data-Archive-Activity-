# Data-Archive-Activity-
Data Tools Assignment

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of the project was to analyze the Human Resources and get some insight about the population of salespeople that has attrition and from who dont have attrition. We calculated the average, min and max showing the monthly income segrated by attrition and non-attrition. In addition, I created a histogram and pie chart to verify visually the population.
  
CONCLUSION
After performing some calculation, I concluded that the number of salespeople that earns monthly salary of around 5,000 has the major concentration with a total amount of 77. In addition, only 26% of the people has attrition, and we also notice that majority of the salespeople with attrition their salary are 
either in 2,000 or 5,000.
